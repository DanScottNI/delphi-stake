	  <td class="tts">v1.0 - The rewrite.
<p>
- Code of the program completely rewritten. Legacy code ported over to class based 
  system.<br>
- Stake will now check the ROM that you load and see if it's PRG, CHR and mapper number
  are correct for a Castlevania ROM. If it is not correct, it will refuse to load the
  ROM.<br>
- Stairs now utilise the pointers to the stairs data, in preparation for the stairs
  adding system.<br>
- User interface tweak to the Up, Down, Left, Right button. Now, they are BitBtn's,
  with relevant bitmaps, and they are moved to the position where scrollbars would be.<br>
- Upgraded to GR32 1.5.1.<br>
- Uses Sire's stair, door, and entrance icons.<br>
- Middle button of the mouse is now used for an extra currently selected tile. If you
  don't have a middle button, Shift + Left Click is also provided.<br>
- Stairs adding function coded. Hardcored to allow you to have only 50 stairs per stage.
  Changeable via a constant, but a smart hacker may want to repoint something else in that
  bank, so I may as well leave the space for them to do so.<br>
- Stairs deleting function coded. Utilised through CTRL + Right click on a stair.<br>
- Minor entrance and door bugs fixed.<br>
- ROM properties statistics replaced by a value editor.<br>
- ROM assembly hacks are replaced by SPF files.<br>
- You now have to have the ROM closed to change the datafile.<br>
- Stake now displays text in the tile selector which can tell you which tile is mapped
  to which mouse button. You can turn this off, or change the colour of the text.<br>
- Added an 8x8 Tile Editor. This is an extremely basic tile editor for what is 
  currently stored in the BG pattern table. Accessible via the middle clicking on the 
  TSA editor whilst hovering over the tile you want to edit.
